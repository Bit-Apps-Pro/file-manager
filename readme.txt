== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Invalid backend configuration. Readable volumes not available. =

Please check your file permission from your hosting panel. The permission must be 0755 for file/folder. If you are using a vps(virtual private server) then you must ensure that the owner of your installation is PHP aka www-data. Another reason could be wrong root folder path/url. Inserting a correct root folder path/URL should fix the issue.

= I can not upload larger files then *MB =

You can upload any size of file. Library file manager plugin uploads files in chunks. So a very large file can be easily uploaded & downloaded.

= Can I preview .psd and document files? =

Yes, documents like PSD, DOCX can be previewd via file manager preview.

= Can I change file permission like cPanel? =

Yes, file/folder permission can be changed like cPanel and other hosting management interfaces. It is very easy. Just right click on the file and you will see a menu named **Change Mode **. Clicking will open a dialogue box, where you can update the file permission, just like cPanel.
